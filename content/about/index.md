## About This Journal

Welcome to my homelab journal! This is where I document my journey building, maintaining, and learning from my home laboratory environment.

### What You'll Find Here

- **Wiki**: Reference documentation on technologies I use
- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides you can follow
- **Posts**: Journey updates and project progress
- **Lessons Learned**: Mistakes made and insights gained

### Why I Write

1. **Learning by teaching** - Writing forces me to truly understand what I'm doing
2. **Future reference** - My future self will thank me for documenting this
3. **Sharing knowledge** - Maybe something here helps someone else

### My Homelab Philosophy

> "Build it yourself, understand how it works, and learn from every failure."

I believe in:
- **Self-hosting** where practical
- **Automation** to reduce toil
- **Documentation** to preserve knowledge
- **Experimentation** without fear of breaking things

### Topics Covered

- **Virtualization**: Proxmox VE, LXC containers, VM management
- **Networking**: VLANs, DNS, firewalls, VPNs
- **Automation**: n8n, scripting, CI/CD
- **Monitoring**: Logging, alerting, observability
- **Storage**: NAS, backups, data management

### Disclaimer

All content here reflects my personal homelab environment. Examples use placeholders like `<YOUR_IP>` and `<YOUR_DOMAIN>` - always adapt configurations to your own setup.

**This is not production-grade advice.** It's a learning journal. Test everything in your own environment.
