## Hello, World!

Welcome to my homelab journal. After years of tinkering, building, breaking, and rebuilding my home infrastructure, I've decided it's time to document the journey.

## Why Now?

I've learned *so much* from other people's blogs, tutorials, and documentation. It feels right to give back to the community that helped me get started.

Plus, I've lost count of how many times I've had to re-learn something because I didn't write it down the first time.

## What Is a Homelab?

For the uninitiated, a "homelab" is a personal computing environment used for learning, experimentation, and self-hosting services. It can be as simple as a Raspberry Pi running Pi-hole, or as complex as a multi-node Proxmox cluster with enterprise networking.

Mine falls somewhere in between.

## What I'm Running

At a high level, my homelab includes:

- **Virtualization**: Proxmox VE cluster
- **Containers**: Docker and LXC
- **Networking**: VLANs, managed switches, high-availability DNS
- **Automation**: n8n, custom scripts, CI/CD pipelines
- **Monitoring**: Centralized logging with Graylog
- **Storage**: Synology NAS devices

I'll be documenting each of these in the [wiki](/wiki/) and creating [tutorials](/tutorials/) for the setups I'm proud of.

## What to Expect

This journal will include:

1. **Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides for setting up services
2. **Architecture Overviews**: How things are connected
3. **Lessons Learned**: The mistakes and what they taught me
4. **Updates**: What I'm working on and experimenting with

## A Note on Security

All examples in this journal use placeholders. You won't find my actual IP addresses, domain names, or credentials anywhere here. Please substitute your own values when following along.

## Let's Go

I'm excited to share this journey. If you're reading this, thanks for stopping by. I hope something here helps you on your own homelab adventure.
