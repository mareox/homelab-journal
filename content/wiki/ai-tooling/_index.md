AI-augmented homelab operations — from multi-agent orchestration to automated content pipelines. This wiki documents how Claude Code and agentic patterns accelerate infrastructure work.

## 4-Layer Agentic Architecture

A framework for organizing AI-assisted automation into composable layers:

- [4-Layer Agentic Architecture]({{< relref "/posts/2026/4-layer-agentic-architecture" >}}) — Justfile → Commands → Skills → Agents: how each layer has a single responsibility

## Skill Development

Building custom Claude Code skills for repeatable workflows:

- [HTML Slides Skill Development]({{< relref "/posts/2026/html-slides-skill-development" >}}) — Lessons from creating a presentation-generation skill

## AI-Assisted Blog Pipeline

End-to-end automation from homelab work to published blog post:

- [Automated Blog Pipeline]({{< relref "/posts/2026/automated-blog-pipeline" >}}) — Git commit scanning, content generation, Hugo publishing, and Discord notifications

## Second Brain (Draft)

Building a persistent knowledge system with Claude Code — daily logs, weekly reflections, and project memory. Coming soon.
